			<br/>
			<p>My name is Brian Olsen, I am a Masters student at Purdue University studying Computer Science.  
			My primary interests focus on algorithms that support emerging technologies in database systems. 
			I am also interested in distributed and parallel systems. I am a skillful programmer and know valuable 
			languages such as C++, Java, Python and many others.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>I served six years with the Marine Corps and got out with an honorable discharge as a Sergeant. 
			Within that time my job was to maintain data communications through networking systems for a battalion during field 
			operations and back at our headquarters.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>My strengths are that I am very dependable. Through my years as a Marine Sergeant I wasn't only required to be 
			punctual and resourceful for my superiors, but would require that from my subordinates as well and I understand the 
			importance of not only being present and on time but prepared for the work day as well.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>I also take initiative when I see a problem or an inefficient method of handling a task. I always look for a better, quicker, or more efficient 
			way of doing something while minding the quality of my work.</p>
